# n-layered-slab
The project contains MATLAB code for plotting the reflectance vs the angle of incidence and wavelength in an n-layered slab with each layer having complex refractive indices and also study the affect of temperature. The code was written for my undergraduate sophmore year course "PHN-205 Engineering Analysis and Design". The exact problem statement was: "Write a program to determine the reflectance for a multilayered structure consisting of different dielectric materials of various thicknesses. Analyse the speacial case of d=lambda/2. Also see its behavior for different temperatures and wavelengths as a function of incidence angle"
